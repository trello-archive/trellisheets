      <h1>Trello Terms of Service</h1>

      <h2>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>

      <p>IMPORTANT -- READ CAREFULLY: BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT OR BY UTILIZING THE TRELLO SERVICE YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>

      <p>Welcome to the Trello service, website or mobile application (collectively, the "Service"). Your use of the Service is subject to these Terms of Service and <a href="https://trello.com/privacy{{#mobileApp}}?mobileApp=1{{/mobileApp}}" title="Trello Privacy Policy">Trello’s Privacy Policy</a> (collectively, the “Terms of Service” or “Agreement”). These Terms of Service are a legal agreement between You and Trello, Inc. (“Trello”), a Delaware Corporation, for use of the Trello service. "You" refers to any individual who creates an account on the Service, or, if the Service is being used on behalf of an entity by an individual authorized to agree to such terms on behalf of such entity, then "You" refers to such entity. If You are accessing the Service on behalf of Your employer, you represent and warrant that You have the authority to agree to these Terms of Service on its behalf. If You do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, do not use the Service. Trello reserves the right to update and change the Agreement from time to time without notice or acceptance by You. The Agreement will also be applicable to the use of the Service on a trial basis. By using the Service, You signify Your irrevocable acceptance of this Agreement.
      The website and any downloadable software associated with the Service are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.</p>

      <h2>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h2>

      <p>The Service includes, and is limited to, a service, web site, or mobile application that allows You access to and use of a single Trello Account. "Trello" referred to herein means an online collaboration tool that organizes projects into boards.  The Service may contain information, data, text, photographs, videos, audio clips, written posts and comments, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Service (collectively, “Content”).   Subject to these Terms of Service, Trello grants to You and each user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use (i.e., to download and display locally) Content solely for purposes of using the Service. Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Content for other than purposes of using the Service is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from us. You shall not sell, license, rent, or otherwise use or exploit any Content for commercial use or in any way that violates any third party right.  For the purposes of these Terms of Service, “Content” also includes all User Content (as defined below).</p>

      <p>A "Trello Account" or "Account" referred to herein means a service, web site, or mobile application, provided by Trello, where You may use Trello to create, update, share, and publish information, data, text, messages or other materials ("User Content").</p>

      <p>Without limiting the foregoing, the Service is not designed or licensed for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe controls, including without limitation operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation/communication systems, air traffic control, and life support or weapons systems.</p>

      <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Agreement. In order to use the Service, You must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, You must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device. You also understand and agree that the service may include certain communications from Trello, such as service announcements, administrative messages, etc., and that these communications are considered part of the Service and You will not be able to opt out of receiving them. You agree not to access the Service by any means other than through the interfaces that are provided by Trello for use in accessing the Service. Trello will provide the Service in accordance with this Agreement. Trello may at its sole discretion modify the features of the Service from time to time without prior notice.</p>

      <h2>REGISTRATION</h2>

      <p>In order to use the Service, You must have a valid Account. To acquire an Account for the Service, You must provide Trello with an electronic mail address and other information ("Registration Data"). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the access data for Your Account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under Your Account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Trello of any unauthorized use of Your Account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that You exit from Your Account at the end of each session. Trello cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from Your failure to comply with this section. In consideration of use of the Service, You agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about Yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form, and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. Trello assumes no duty to verify such information as further detailed in the CONTENT OF THE SERVICE section of these Terms of Service. If You provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Trello has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Trello has the right to suspend or terminate Your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). By using the Service (and registering an Account on the Service), You represent and warrant that You are at least 13 years of age, and no one under the age of 13 may use the Service - except as set forth below under "Kids Under 13 and Trello".  Trello may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms of Service are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you and the right to access the Service is revoked where these Terms of Service or use of the Service is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale or provision of the Service conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>

      <h2 id="kids">KIDS UNDER 13 AND TRELLO</h2>

      <p>Trello is not directed to children, and we expect that any use by children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. Trello relies on parents and guardians to ensure that minors only use Trello if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as laid out in these Terms of Service and in our Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>In the event that you are a school, district or teacher in the United States and want your students, who are under the age of 13, to create Trello accounts - including in conjunction with the establishment of a Trello Gold or Business Class account - you agree that you are responsible for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and, to the extent applicable, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). This means that you must notify the students' parents/guardians of the personally identifiable information that Trello will collect, and that you will obtain parental/guardian consent before your students establish accounts or use Trello. When obtaining such consent, you must provide parents/guardians with a copy of our <a href="https://trello.com/privacy{{#mobileApp}}?mobileApp=1{{/mobileApp}}" title="Trello Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>.  You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. For more information on complying with COPPA, see <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm">the Federal Trade Commission's website</a>. If you are located outside of the United States, we will rely upon you to obtain any required consent or approval from the parent or guardian of any student covered by similar laws, and, as a condition to your and your students' use of Trello, you agree that you will be responsible for complying with such laws.</p>

      <h2>BILLING/PAYMENT TERMS</h2>

      <p>Additional groupings of features may be added to the Service and made available to You as a paid upgrade ("Paid Plan"). If You choose to subscribe to a Paid Plan, You shall pay fees (described below) to Trello. Upon selection of a Paid Plan, You will provide Trello with the necessary billing information ("Billing Data").</p>

      <p>Credit cards are the only payment mechanism Trello will accept for payment of a monthly or yearly subscription fee ("Subscription Fee") for a Paid Plan. All currency references are in U.S. dollars. Paid Plans can be paid as either a monthly Subscription Fee or a yearly Subscription Fee.</p>

      <p>If you select a Paid Plan, You must provide current, complete and accurate Billing Data.  You must promptly update all Billing Data to keep Your Account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date) and You must promptly notify Trello if Your Payment Method is changed (for example, for loss or theft) or if You become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of Your name or password.  If You fail to provide any of the foregoing information, You agree that Trello may continue charging You for any use of the Paid Plan under your Billing Data unless You have terminated Your Paid Plan as set forth herein.</p>

      <p>If You select the Monthly Fee, the credit card that You provide as part of the Billing Data will be automatically and immediately billed on the first Business Day of each Month. You agree that Trello may charge to Your credit card all amounts due and owing for Your Account on that monthly basis or upon cancellation (see "Termination, Breach, Suspension and Cancellation" and "Refund"). If You select the Yearly Fee, the credit card that You provide as part of the Billing Data will be automatically and immediately billed on the day You sign up. You agree that Trello may charge to Your credit card all amounts due and owing for Your Account on that yearly basis unless you cancel the account (see the "Termination, Breach, Suspension and Cancellation" and "Refund" sections of these Terms of Service). Trello will contact You via electronic mail to alert You upon each charge. Trello may change prices at any time without prior notice, but will endeavor to provide reasonable advance notice via the Trello website and/or electronic mail. You agree that in the event Trello is unable to collect the fees owed to Trello for Your Account through Your Subscription Fee, Trello may take any other steps it deems necessary to collect such fees from You and that You will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Trello in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs and attorneys' fees.</p>

      <p>As long as Your Account remains active and in good standing, You will be charged the Subscription Fee even if You never use the service. You may, however, cancel Your Paid Plan at any time.</p>

      <h2>TERMINATION, BREACH, SUSPENSION AND CANCELLATION</h2>

      <p>If Your Subscription Fee payment is overdue, Trello will disable Your access to the features provided by the Paid Plan. Trello may, at its sole discretion, at any time and for any reason, terminate the Service, terminate this Agreement, or suspend or terminate Your Account. In the event of suspension or termination, Your account will be disabled and You may not be granted access to Your Account or any files or other Content (including Your User Content) contained in Your Account, and Trello may delete Your User Content, although residual copies of information may remain in our system for some time for back-up purposes. In the event of termination, Trello may also withdraw and at its discretion reallocate the public web address of Your Account.</p>

      <p>If You terminate Your Account, via means provided for cancellation on the Trello website, or via telephone call or electronic mail to Trello, and You request that Trello delete Your User Content and files contained in Your Account, Trello will make all reasonable efforts to do so.</p>

      <h2>REFUND</h2>

      <p>Trello provides means for Account and Paid Plan cancellation on the Trello website. If You cancel Your Account within 90 calendar days of the date of sign up, and You request a refund, Trello will refund all payments You have made to Trello within the 90 calendar days prior to the cancellation and refund request.</p>

      <h2>PROPRIETARY/INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>

      <p>Trello and/or its suppliers, as applicable, retain ownership of all proprietary rights in the Service and in all trade names, trademarks and service marks associated or displayed with the Service. You will not remove, deface or obscure any of Trello's or its suppliers' copyright or trademark notices and/or legends or other proprietary notices on, incorporated therein, or associated with the Service. You may not reverse engineer, reverse compile or otherwise reduce to human readable form any software associated with the Service.</p>

      <p>Trello is a Trademark of Trello, Inc.</p>

      <h2>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS</h2>

      <p>You acknowledge that the Service, or portion thereof may be subject to the export control laws of the United States. You will not export, re-export, divert, transfer or disclose any portion of the Service or any related technical information or materials, directly or indirectly, in violation of any applicable export law or regulation.</p>

      <h2>INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</h2>

      <p>You acknowledge that any use of the Service contrary to this Agreement, or any transfer, sublicensing, copying or disclosure of technical information or materials related to the Service, may cause irreparable injury to Trello, its affiliates, suppliers and any other party authorized by Trello to resell, distribute, or promote the Service ("Resellers"), and under such circumstances Trello, its affiliates, suppliers and Resellers will be entitled to equitable relief, without posting bond or other security, including, but not limited to, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.</p>

      <h2>PROPER USE</h2>

      <p>Trello does not claim ownership over any User Content submitted on or through the Service.  Your User Content belongs to You.  However, by uploading any User Content to the Service, You agree that Trello may store and display (only to You, to the extent that You make such User Content private) Your User Content solely as necessary in connection with the Service.  To the extent You choose to share any of Your User Content with other users of the Service, You agree to allow these users (i.e., only the users you specify) to view Your User Content and, to the extent applicable, collaborate with You and Your User Content.</p>

      <p>You understand that all User Content is the sole responsibility of the person from which such User Content originated. This means that You, and not Trello, are entirely responsible for all User Content that You upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available via Your Account. Trello does not control the User Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such User Content.</p>

      <p>You understand that by using the Service, You may be exposed to User Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Trello be liable in any way for any User Content, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge that Trello does not pre-screen User Content, but that Trello and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse, modify or move any Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Trello and its designees shall have the right to remove any User Content that violates the Agreement or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that You must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, You acknowledge that You may not reasonably rely on any Content created by Trello or submitted to Trello. You acknowledge and agree that Trello may preserve User Content and may also disclose User Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:</p>
      <p>(a) comply with legal process;</p>
      <p>(b) enforce the Agreement;</p>
      <p>(c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; or</p>
      <p>(d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Trello, its users and the public.</p>

      <p>If Trello discloses User Content to comply with legal process or respond to claims that any User Content violates the rights of third-parties, to the extent permitted by law, regulation or legal process, Trello agrees to provide You with prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with You in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure.</p>

      <p>You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including Your User Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.</p>

      <p>Should User Content be found or reported to be in violation with, but not limited to, the following terms, it will be in Trello's sole discretion as to what action should be taken. You agree that You will not:</p>

      <p>(a) upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available any User Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy (up to, but not excluding any address, email, phone number, or any other contact information without the written consent of the owner of such information), hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;</p>
      <p>(b) harm minors in any way;</p>
      <p>(c) impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, a Trello official, forum leader, guide or host, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent Your affiliation with a person or entity;</p>
      <p>(d) forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any User Content transmitted through the Service;</p>
      <p>(e) upload, post or otherwise transmit any User Content that You do not have a right to transmit under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information, proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements);</p>
      <p>(f) upload, post or otherwise transmit any User Content that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, rights of privacy or publicity, or other proprietary rights of any party;</p>
      <p>(g) upload, post, or transmit unsolicited commercial email or "spam". This includes unethical marketing, advertising, or any other practice that is in any way connected with "spam", including but not limited to (a) sending mass email to recipients who haven't requested email from You or with a fake return address, (b) promoting a site with inappropriate links, titles, descriptions, or (c) promoting Your site by posting multiple submissions in public forums that are identical;</p>
      <p>(h) upload, post or otherwise transmit any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;</p>
      <p>(i) interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the Service;</p>
      <p>(j) intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, national or international law, including, but not limited to, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any rules of any national or other securities exchange, including without limitation, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, and any regulations having the force of law;</p>
      <p>(k) "stalk" or otherwise harass another;</p>
      <p>(l) promote or provide instructional information about illegal activities, promote physical harm or injury against any group or individual, or promote any act of cruelty to animals. This may include, without limitation, providing instructions on how to assemble bombs, grenades and other weapons or incendiary devices.</p>
      (m) offer for sale or sell any item, good or service that (i) violates any applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation, (ii) You do not have full power and authority under all relevant laws and regulations to offer and sell, including all necessary licenses and authorizations, or (iii) Trello determines, in its sole discretion, is inappropriate for sale through the Service provided by Trello;<p></p>
      <p>(n) use the Account website as a redirecting/forwarding service to another website;</p>
      <p>(o) exceed the scope of the Service that You have signed up for; for example, accessing and using the tools that You do not have a right to use, or having humans share User logins, or deleting, adding to, or otherwise changing other people's comments or User Content as an Account holder. If any user is reported to be in violation with the letter or spirit of these terms, Trello retains the right to terminate such account at any time without further warning.</p>
